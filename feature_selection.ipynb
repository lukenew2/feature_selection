    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "---\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of selecting the features that hold the most predictive power to the target. By removing unnecessary features, we reduce model complexity and minimize the computational resources required for training and inference.  Feature selection is a crucial step that can have a great impact on model efficiency in production settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods of feature selection we will perform are:\n",
    "* Filter Methods\n",
    "    * Correlation\n",
    "    * Univariate Feature Selection\n",
    "* Wrapper Methods\n",
    "    * Forward Selection\n",
    "    * Backward Selection\n",
    "    * Recursive Feature Elimination\n",

    "    * Feature Importance (Tree-based)\n",

    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the feature selection methods above on the [Census Income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29) dataset from the UCI repository. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features with the goal to predict whether a person's salary is greater than or equal to $50k."
